I STOLE one decision from JuliusMod, I do not care if he wants it back it is mine now.
4th-Kaiser for making several racist remarks inside of the mod, and being the laziest worker I have ever seen. Addendum; He is now a slightly less lazy worker.
Theagle for shouting at me 1 time, not sure why but he hates how I save my files.
Thrashes for abandoning me in my time of need, they say that tortured artists are better and this PROVES it.
MSLT for leaving the server.
TrueCookieKing for showing me that even retards like me could make mods.
Siiarla for reinvigorating my love for Epic Rap Battles of History.

IGoR - I ripped out the state sizing system cause it is imo the best way to do states warscore cost.
JuliusMod - Pretty sure this is where my transfer system is from, unsure tho...
Rennes - Did some fucking magic that I could not even begin to comprehend to understand, but nontheless it made the mod much more optimized. Also helped me set up the GitHub. Huge thanks to him!
