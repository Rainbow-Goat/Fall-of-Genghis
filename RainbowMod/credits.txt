I STOLE one decision from JuliusMod, I do not care if he wants it back it is mine now.
4th-Kaiser for making several racist remarks inside of the mod, and being the laziest worker I have ever seen. Addendum; He is now a slightly less lazy worker.
Theagle for shouting at me 1 time, not sure why but he hates how I save my files.
Thrashes for abandoning me in my time of need, they say that tortured artists are better and this PROVES it.
MSLT for leaving the server.
TrueCookieKing for showing me that even retards like me could make mods.
Siiarla for reinvigorating my love for Epic Rap Battles of History.
