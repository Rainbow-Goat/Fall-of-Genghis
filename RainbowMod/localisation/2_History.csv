100601DESC;The Duchy of Normandy is a highly independent member of the French Confederation. Ever since William the Failed claimed the throne of Englaland they have been fighting for it in a series of conflicts. Orleansian hesitancy and Burgundian interference has stopped us from taking what is rightfully ours for the past thousands years but now we finally have an oppertunity to conquer Englaland! The Welsh, having grown tired of Saxon dominance, have rebelled and joined with our cause for a more just and equal kingdom. It is do or die.;x;
