EVTNAME5002;Stanley Cup;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC5002;Lord Stanley of Preston was very intrigued by ice hockey as he became Governor-General of the Dominion. Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was donated in 1892 by him, as an award for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. ;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME5001;World Cup of Football;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC5001;Uruguay have just hosted the first World Cup of Football, which was a stellar success. Even though not many countries managed to travel here from Europe, there were still great football played. And what was most important of all, Uruguay won the final 4-2 over Argentina!;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME5000;First FA Cup Played;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC5000;In a hard fought thrilling game, the first FA cup was today played at the Kensington Oval in London. In a surprise result, the $PROVINCENAME$ Albion won with 1-0 over Queens Park. The Spiders showed a lot of sportsmanship during the game, but eventually lost to a goal by Alfred Goodwyn in the second half.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME22500;Stock Market Crash!;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22500;A bleak day today for $COUNTRY$, as $CAPITAL$'s financial district reels from the shock of a burst speculation bubble. Real estate prices have been soaring for the past year and a half, and while some analysts have warned for quite some time that the prices have been artificially high due to the effects of inflationary over consumption, the matadors of the bull market have left any such warnings unheeded. In government circles, cries for increased bank and currency regulations are being heard, calling for an end to what is referred to as 'the failures of dog-eat-dog capitalism'.;;;;;;x;

great_depression;A stock market crash in one of the Great Powers has caused a great depression, the effects of which are being felt all around the civilized world.;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME22510;The Great Depression;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22510;A major crash on the $CAPITAL$ stock market has devolved into something much worse entirely, following massive bank runs triggered by plummeting saver's confidence in the banking sector. As people scramble to secure their life savings, more and more banks and credit institutions fail, triggering domino effects affecting the entire $COUNTRY_ADJ$ financial sector. The ripples from the crash soon spread to other sectors of private industry, as loans are defaulted and savings vanish seemingly into thin air. Widespread unemployment, caused by entire sectors of industry failing almost overnight, soon follow. With the intertwining of the economies of the western world, the crisis quickly spreads to other countries, and the effects of the crash now reverberate around the world, in what will be known to posterity as: The $YEAR$ Great Depression.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA22510;It's only a temporary crisis, no one can be blamed;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME22520;Free Banking;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22520;As there are no laws prohibiting or regulating private banking practices in $COUNTRY$, several private institutions are issuing their own currencies. While some argue that the hard earned savings of the common man are far too important to be left to the private sector, the case is rather the opposite in one of our states, where the plethora of banking institutions available allows people the freedom of choice to save their money in banks, and thus currencies, which they actually know and trust.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA22520;There is always the chance that these systems will fail, and then what?;;;;;x;;

EVTNAME22530;Local Railway Shares;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22530;A newly formed railway company in one of our states has issued shares in the company to help finance the burgeoning firm, and are now seeking buyers and investors in the state. The CEO of the company has approached local politicians, asking them if they could, perhaps, lend a bit of a hand in the marketing of these shares to the general public, arguing that an extension of the railway networks in the state can only be beneficial and should be promoted. Some feel that this might infringe on the principles of official neutrality with regards to private ventures, while other see only opportunities.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA22530;Of course we must aid and help promote this beautiful private initiative;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC22550;A bank run has ensued in one of our states today, following news that a local bank has been issuing currency to a value far exceeding its liquid assets. The situation has been raised to the national level and parliament, where opponents of free banking use the case to argue against the system of free banking as such, calling on the government to move toward a tighter regulation of the banking sector, which is opposed by powerful interests within industrialist circles and the free trade lobby.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME22560;Economic Boom;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22560;Our country's economy has been booming of late, following a long period of relatively low unemployment and a well fed populace. High savings and a productive population, combined with advances in the field of economic instruments and the establishment of investment banks, means that we now are better poised than ever before to develop our national industries, and bring our country's economy to new heights.;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME22570;Flagship Company Bankrupt;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22570;One of the major companies in one of our states has gone bankrupt recently, following a long period of running at a deficit. Local politicians have petitioned the government to step in in support of the company, claiming that the downturn is only temporary, and that the company can get back on its feet if allowed some time to reconstruct and consolidate. While we could support the business, vocal members of parliament have lambasted the idea, calling it an absurd abridgment of the fundamental freedoms of trade and government non-interventionism.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA22570;Naturally we must aid the company through this tough time;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB22570;We will not spend government money in support of a private company;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME22580;Railroad Trust Exposed!;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC22580;$COUNTRY$ is abuzz with news of an alleged railroad trust, exposed by an anti-trust commission set up in one of our states. Local capitalists protest the allegations as absurd, claiming that no malicious coordination of prices, or price fixing has occurred. Many among the working classes are irate about the affair, feeling strongly that they are being squeezed hard by capitalist tycoons trying to make a profit out of their hardship. Breaking up the trust will set local railroad building back several years, but not doing it might anger broad strata of our population.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA22580;We must protect our workers at any cost, and this cornered market must be opened.;;;;;;x;

One $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony has, in the past few years, become internationally recognized as the model of a well managed European colony, and the attention that this colony has garnered for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial policy, in the parliaments and courts of Europe, is proving a wonderful boon for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ research and international prestige.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14740;Wonderful!;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14750;Colonial Policy Debated;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14750;And while I fully respect my colleague from the loyal opposition, I still cannot help but to question his motives in again and again bringing up the subject of the expenses of the Colonial Office. The colonies are a cornerstone of government policy, and worth paying for.'\n\nThe colonies are making headlines in $COUNTRY$ again, following a fierce debate in the Upper House. Members of the opposition have argued in favor of a reduction of the budget alotted to the Colonial Office, and both they and majority MPs have conducted major offensives in the Upper House, to try and convince swing-voters and aisle-crossers to come out in support of their respective policies.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14750;Conservative arguments prevail;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14750;Liberal arguments prevail;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14760;Colonial Corruption;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14760;A slowly unraveling corruption scandal in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonial Office shakes $CAPITAL$, as a major newspaper publishes reports detailing an extensive network of bribes and favors, designed to give certain private interests preferential treatment with regards to colonial trade and exploitation. Critics of government policy point to the relatively low wages and poor funds alotted to colonial officials as determining reasons for the scandal, while the prevailing mood in government circles seems to be that a culture of corruption within the private sector is to blame for the poor state of the Colonial Office.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14760;The government must accept responsibility for its own shortcomings;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14760;The office is in the pocket of Big Industry, and Big Industry is to blame!;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14770;$CAPITAL$, You're A Lady;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14770;The growth of our colonies has turned $CAPITAL$ into the constantly expanding cultural and economic nave of an Empire. Every day, with every passing hour, people from every conceivable corner, of the world we have made ours, arrive in our capital: To court our ministers, to trade with merchants, engineers and industrialists, and to experience any one of the multitude of fates that $CAPITAL$ affords its visitors. Standing at $CAPITAL$ Central, one can see all around oneself a small panorama of the world, hear spoken any and all of the varying tongues and languages of the world and smell both the scents and the odors of far away lands. In the annals of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empire, the years around $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the golden age of $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14770;...and may the memory live long;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14780;Colonial Diseases;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14780;While the discovery of new lands has always meant the discovery of new diseases and malaises, one of our colonies has recently begun to develop a reputation of being a particularly disease-ridden place. From malaria to colds both common and uncommon, it seems that travelers to and from the colony always catch or bring that little something unsavory extra. According to reports published by a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ doctor established in the colony, a concerted government effort at draining local swamps and marshes, as well as at improving local sanitation, could help the colony, but, of course, such efforts are not free.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14780;... who cares!?;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14780;Naturally we must aid the colony, and help strive for its betterment;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14790;Colonial Progress;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14790;One of our colonies is reporting astounding successes in the development of local commercial ventures and businesses to the Colonial Office. According to the local governor, the primary reason seems to be an ambitious land reform, undertaken in tandem with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ capitalists and industrialists. The colony is reportedly becoming more attractive to immigrants, and the report reflects well on our industrialists as well.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14790;Fantastic news!;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14790;Cover up the report, lest the capitalists get uppity!;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14800;Colonial Archeology;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14800;An archeological excavation in one of our colonies has yielded fantastic results in the form of several artifacts, tentatively dated to the late paleolithic. The discovery promises to give us new insights in the ancient life and development of the area, and The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archeological society is hailing the discoveries as a great breakthrough for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archeology. The artifacts obviously need to be put in a museum, but where should we put them? The Archeological society strongly argues in favor of The $CAPITAL$ Museum of History, while others have hinted that it might be better to just put them in a local museum.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14800;Just display the baubles somewhere locally;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14800;This will teach future generations about the common heritage of mankind;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14810;The Natives are Restless;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14810;A situation has presented itself in one of our colonies, where several prominent $CAPITAL$ capitalists have controlling interests in local trade. One of their ventures, a small, local machine shop, run by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ specialists, works on western industrial standards well into the small hours of the morning. The sound from the machine shop is preventing anyone and everyone in the immediate vicinity of the shop from getting much sleep at night, and the issue has become a symbol for many, broader, pent up frustrations with our colonial rule.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14810;If the shop needs to operate at those hours, who are we to have opinions about that?;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14810;I suppose we could drop by the Chamber of Commerce and have a chat with the boys...;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME10001;An Age of Liberalism;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC10001;While Napoleon and his armies has been defeated, the fundamental ideas of the French Revolution have not been. In Germany the old crowns of the Holy Roman Empire have been wrought to naught, and the feudal contracts of old replaced by Napoleonic civil codes. Everywhere in Europe, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on Waterloo, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA10001;We can expect increased liberal activity in the coming years;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME10105;Potato Famine Debated;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC10105;And while our people still labor under ghastly conditions in the fields, what has our government done to relieve the starving farmers affected this very year by the dreaded Potato blight? Economic freedom could allow for the import of ersatz foodstuffs, but privileges long established must, apparently, be maintained.'\n\nLiberal sympathizers have come out of the woodwork both locally and in parliament, criticizing our government for its inability to handle the Potato Blight that recently struck one of our provinces. If the liberals become too strong, they may very well conspire again to ferment revolution. We should also consider dispatching troops to provinces where we see Liberal Agitation.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA10105;Suppress them in parliament and hope that the countryside stays calm;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB10105;Let them have their say in parliament, and the effects might dissipate;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB10120;Censor the paper;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME10110;The Watch on $CAPITAL$;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC10110;Fast and true stands the guard in $CAPITAL$, at least if a local poet is to be believed. A poetical pamphlet decrying the state of our nation, its political backwardness and oppression, has inflamed feelings in one of our states. All around $COUNTRY$ cries for national unity can be heard, as liberals take to the streets protesting the old order, calling for national unification with our cultural brethren in other countries, and a liberalization of our political system. We should consider dispatching troops to provinces where Liberal Agitation is present.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA10110;Bloody revolutionaries.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB10110;The old order must be defended!;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME10260;Agitation Suppressed;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14000;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Trade Policy;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14000_sub;A Heated Debate in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism? We report, you decide.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14000;Some protective measures are in order to safe-guard our industry;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTC14000;Let the debate take its own course, and let the chips fall where they may!;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14010_sub;Economic policy debated in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14010;The election debates in $COUNTRY$ have been going on for a few days now, and the issue that seems to be becoming the determining one for the outcome of the election is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the economy. Several theories are being advanced, but the voters want a clear statement on government policy.

EVTDESC14020;The morality and virtue of our people has started to decline!' The statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality, on the campaign trail in $COUNTRY$. Many have begun questioning the country's view on religion, and there is no doubt that these issues will play their part in the coming election.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14020;There are no Gods!;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14020;Religion is not a political issue!;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14040_sub;War Policy Debated in Local Election;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14040;Opponents and proponents of the military and the armed forces are taking sides for the coming election. While militarists argue that increased tension in the world, and arms races between several of the Great Powers, are reason enough to maintain a strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military. Others are less convinced, and see the military expenses as excesses on part of the government.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14040;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14050;Imports, Exports & Tariffs;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME14050_sub;Tariff Policies Debated in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14050;Smuggling has become a problem since $COUNTRY$ raised a local Sales & Transfer tariff on several important trade goods, and the issue has become a point of contention in the coming election. Several arguments are being put forth on the issue.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14050;Raise the tariffs!;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14050;Lower the tariffs on those goods and raise it on some others.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTC14050;Leave the tariffs as they were.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC14060;New foreign, products have begun to out compete several items of $COUNTRY$ produce, and some citizens report increasing difficulties in competing with imported goods on the market. The issue has been raised by local politicians in debates for the upcoming election.;;;;;;x;

EVTOPTA14080;Nonsense. The production quota will remain the same.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14080;You have nothing to worry about.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14090_sub;Regionalism & Interventionism debated;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14090;A debate has flared up in the local $COUNTRY$ election about whether the state should interfere or not in the local economy. Proponents of State capitalism are arguing that a more direct system of government investment and reinvestment could aid in the long term development of local industry.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14090;Naturally, they are right.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB14090;It takes some time, but it will work.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14100_sub;Plans, Economies & Freedoms debated;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14100;Local $COUNTRY$ administration has come under criticism for several instances of government subsidies directed at supporting local industry.  Opponents argue that 'the country's economic planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages, and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production', and creeping statism has begun to worry the residents of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14100;That's rubbish!;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME14110_sub;Religious Policy Debated;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC14110;Some of the Faithful in $COUNTRY$ feel that the state has failed in giving them due recognition for their hard work since the last election. For years, they argue, they have assisted the local community in many ways: caring for the sick, taking care of the orphans and helping the needy. They feel that they deserve some form of support so they can continue to help people, and the issue has become a topic of much discussion in the local election campaign.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14110;Religion is a private matter.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC14120;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ religious policy has become a subject of much debate in the local $COUNTRY$ elections.

EVTDESC14130;Religion has become an issue in the upcoming electoral debates, as a local religious leader in $COUNTRY$ protests the freedom of religious conversions, arguing that the size of his flock is diminishing, and that this change is fundamentally harmful to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ moral fabric.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA14130;Try to keep an open mind.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC14140;The renovation of a local church, using public money, has become a hot topic in the local election of $COUNTRY$. Supporters of the project argue that some government support for religion will help preserve not only faith among the people, and thus a local vanguard against the forces of revolution, while opponents argue that the state must not intervene in matters of private religiosity.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC14160;Certain residents of $COUNTRY$ feel that the state discriminates against them on account of their origin, and this has become a bone of some contention in the local election, as liberals argue that immigrants and aliens should have their rights respected. Opponents and, indeed, public opinion, seems to be of the mind that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is not something that one can simply become overnight, and that the process of naturalization takes years, if not generations.;;;;;;x;

A manifesto has been published, calling for voting reform and a revival of what is referred to as 'Those ancient and traditional liberties of $COUNTRY$'.

Many of the ancient societies, Rome and Greece, were looked to for inspiration by liberal thinkers seeing in them proto examples and experiments in those same traditions of freedom that they sought to implement in the modern era. A local Reform Club has republished some select pieces of ancient literature that are becoming high fashion among the educated elites of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;x;

The author's work is a passionate argument for liberty and the disestablishment of the established monarchical order of the old world, in favor of the rights of peoples and republics.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC10300;The chamber of commerce in one of our states has lodged an angry protest with local government, complaining that the government's economic policy of economic interventionism harms local business by distorting the fundamental logic of the free market. Inspired by enlightenment publications on free trade and laissez faire by the French Physiocrats and the Scottish enlightenment, the Chamber of Commerce demands that the government's policy change, and that they be left alone to conduct business in the manners which they see fit. If their demands are not met, they threaten to raise the issue to the national level.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME10320;A Treatise On Economics;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC10320;A Liberal professor at one of our universities has published a pamphlet on economics that has received serious attention in liberal circles both in $COUNTRY$ and abroad. The pamphlet is a profound little tract, arguing in eloquent terms the virtues of freemarketeering and laissez faire, and the author is now being mentioned in the same breath as luminaires such as Ricardo and Smith. We could decry the pamphlet as a spurious piece of liberal propaganda, but, then again, he might have a point?;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA10320;Obviously we must take pride in this publication!;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB10320;Certainly, this is only propaganda designed to exploit the working classes.;;;;;;x;

After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846.

enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman's Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century. First advocated in the writings of early liberal philosophers, such as England's Mary Woolstonecraft or John Stuart Mill, the idea and ideology of Woman's Suffrage gradually developed, as the century wore on, into a coherent ideology in its own right: Feminism. The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman's right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.;;;;;;x;

With several international delegates present, some of whom women, a motion was put before the convention that female delegates, while they should be heard before the chamber, should ultimately be denied the right to vote on any resolutions to be adopted by the convention. The seating arrangements alone have become an issue, as men and women at the convention sit segregated.

This policy, so say the learned of industry, has already been proven successful in several small-scale attempts, where women have been found to be nowhere near the slow learners that common wisdom had otherwise made them out to be. Apparently, they are quite capable of handling the tasks assigned to them in a factory environment. The age of wonders is not past, it seems.;;;;;;x;

In what has been described as the biggest career blunder in the decade, the general has advocated the inclusion of women in the work place, in factories and businesses, arguing primarily that their inclusion and protection under law would only amount to a confirmation of the already established de facto state of women being employed.;;;;;;x;

The sight of the two, relatively frail, upper class women, standing with their placards outside the bar, picketing for Woman's Suffrage and temperance, is not only being made into an object of ridicule, it is also causing some anger among the lower classes, who feel that the well-offs, the high-and-mighties and the holier-than-thous are trying to patronize (or matronize, as the case may be) them with sophistry and rhetoric.;;;;;;x;

westernize_nation_desc;Our country is under intellectual assault by modernity and the Western World. In the fields of modern technology, industry and military theory, the old traditions and institutions no longer serve us as they used to. Everywhere we turn, western influences spread like wildfire through our nation, our population, and our souls. If we are to remain what we always have been, and not become something else entirely, now is the time to assume control of our own destiny. It has become apparent to the leading members of our intellectual elite, that the only way to turn the tide on the Western Leviathan is to swim with it, for, as Sun Tzu says: The reed that bends before the wind, also offers a form of resistance.;;;;;;x;

the_meiji_restoration_desc;Japan is traditionally considered to have been founded by Emperor Jimmu in 660 B.C., and while the Imperial Lineage was still considered unbroken since then, the Imperial Office had, throughout the Edo period, been reduced to a revered and respected but, ultimately, politically powerless institution. By embracing a restoration of Imperial Rule, along with a programme of swift industrial modernization, constitutionalism and economic freedom, Japan might be able to break the fetters placed upon her by the impositions of the Western World.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC10000;The relative quiet of the early 19th century was broken with a crashing revelry in $YEAR$, as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the continent. The Monarchical Ancien Regimes of Europe could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the French revolution could again be heard echoing from Europe's tumultuous streets, and student's and youth again gathered under republican tricolors, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in economic, cultural, social and national affairs -- that was European Liberalism.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17530;Bloody Strike!;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17530;A strike today in one of our states, initiated by communist troublemakers and revolutionaries, was swiftly put down by local police. The event has caused a massive backlash against the socialist movement in the state, as local farmers & peasants perceive the red ideology as being vehemently opposed to the traditions and histories of civilization in general, and , $COUNTRY$, more importantly.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC17540;Workers in a machine shop in one of our states have gone out in strike, protesting all manner of ills, real or perceived, in society as a whole and in the workplace. What is infinitely worse than a few redbeards taking a few days off, however, is that many other workers from all across the state have joined them in a state-wide sympathy strike, causing the productive engine of the state to grind to a more or less immediate halt. Harsh methods might have to be employed to resolve this little situation.;;;;;;x;

The Red Star publishes deeply moving social commentary, seldom without picturesque little reports on the conditions of working men and women across the world. The Red Star stands, or so it claims, for international solidarity, worker's rights, unionism and class struggle on a broad, democratic and socialist basis.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC17580;There's foxes in the hen house,'\ncows out in the corn.\nThe unions have been busted,\ntheir proud red banners torn'\n- Steve Earle\n\nCapitalists in one of our states have begun employing union busting tactics to end what they describe as 'the scourge of organized labour'. By employing professional infiltrators to get under the skin of the state's labour movement, the capitalists hope to be able to sow discontent among the union rank and file.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17590;Lockout!;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17590;Capitalists in one of our states have called a lockout following a period of intensifying labour conflicts in the area. Workers have been informed by management that no one is welcome back to work while union sympathies still run high among the employed. Local police have expressed support for the move, citing a long series of disturbances at the factory, some even bordering on sabotage.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17600;Black Flags;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17600;The socialist party in one of our states has recently begun undergoing a distinct metamorphosis, under the influence of its young, charismatic leader. While the party still maintains several core tenants of socialism, such as the emphasis on the state's important societal role, it has also begun embracing an aggressive and bombastic form of radical nationalism. Black flags have begun waving from the socialist party headquarters in one of our states, and while still prefixed with 'proto-', it is clear that what we are seeing is the formation of a radical new front in the state's politics: Fascism.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA17600;An interesting development that we will make sure to keep an eye on.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB17600;Let us see if we cannot defuse some of this enthusiasm into more palatable forms;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME17610;Blackshirts;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17610;The emerging fascist party in one of our states has formed a paramilitary corps, organized with a military command chain, ideologically coherent and ready to do the bidding of the fascist party leaders. The group is colloquially referred to as the 'Blackshirts' from the iconic militaresque shirts that they have taken to wearing. This trend is new to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politics, and some fear that it might lead to a chain-reaction, with other parties forming military organizations of their own.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA17610;Clamp down on the organization and attempt to shut it down;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB17610;Leave them be, and hope that they don't gain too much ground;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME17620;Fascist Soup kitchens;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17620;The fascist party has begun organizing soup kitchens for the unemployed in one of our states, citing the need to 'Protect and preserve the pureborn $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industrial workers from the ravages of international capitalism'. Several other parties, along with leading liberal and conservative dailies, have expressed sharp criticism of the party's work, claiming that it, in the end, amounts to little less than bribery and the buying of voter support. The fascists themselves do not seem overly concerned about these accusations.;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA17620;The party's work is not illegal, and is therefore not a government concern;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB17620;This is just a ruse to build support for the party, end this nonsense!;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME17630;The March on $CAPITAL$;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17630;Reports have reached $CAPITAL$ that the Blackshirts, the paramilitary wing of the fascist party, have begun marching down the country, toward $CAPITAL$, intent on seizing power in $COUNTRY$. The military has thus far not attempted to intervene, and we suspect that this might be due to the fact that several leading members of our armed forces have fascist sympathies themselves. This is definitely a crisis for the young $COUNTRY_ADJ$ democracy.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17640;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Free Corps;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17640;War veterans, disgruntled with what they see as the failures of capitalism and liberal democracy, have formed a Free Corps -- an ideological an paramilitary organization ostensibly existing to protect the state and homeland, while de facto promoting a fascist political agenda -- in one of our states. The corps has already begun flexing its muscles in local politics, threatening several liberal politicians and maintaining a fairly intimidating uniformed presence in the state.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17650;Fascist Newspaper;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17650;A fascist newspaper has begun circulating in one of our states. The paper, '$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Dawn', carries fiery denunciations of everything between heaven and earth, including, but certainly not limited to, communists, socialists, liberals, conservatives, foreigners, minorities, women, homosexuals, capitalists, deviants and criminals. While the paper carries a fair amount of vitriol, it does still manage to capitalize fairly well on several of the attitudes that are prevalent among fairly broad strata of our society, whatever that says about $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17660;Dogma of Violence;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17660;Political violence has claimed several lives in one of our states, as fascist paramilitaries stormed the headquarters of the local liberal party yesterday, killing three and wounding several more. The action has been met with reaction during the night, as fascists, socialists and citizen guards engage in street-fighting throughout. The situation has exploded out of a relative calm, and many of the citizens in the state are angry, afraid and concerned about where the country is heading, with several suggesting increased police budgets as a means to ensure state control.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC17670;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fascist party has embarked on a political propaganda campaign, denouncing everything that they consider to be foreign influences on $COUNTRY$, particularly targeting minorities and immigrants. The party campaign appeals to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ xenophobia, and agitates, sotto voce, for the expulsion of those immigrants from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state. Several leading intellectuals have denounced the campaign as inflammatory, and have expressed support for our national minorities.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC17680;Fascists have taken to the streets of one of our states in a show of force for the party and its various sub-organizations. Clad in their black and brown shirts, marching in military order through the streets, drums beating, the fascists are an intimidating sight to behold. Several members of our cabinet are suggesting that the presence of, what effectively amounts to, military units not under state control is becoming more and more of an issue, and are suggesting we outlaw paramilitary organizations.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17690;Beer Hall Putsch;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17690;The fascist party in one of our states is in the process of rising up in open revolution, as news reach us today that they have set up headquarters in a local beer hall, and have read, from its stairs, a declaration of a takeover of state and government functions in the state. Our cabinet is divided on how to handle the situation, but there seems to be some consensus that the local police should be quite capable of handling the situation once they mobilize. Others argue that the revolt must be put down with every available means. Doing the latter risks building support for the fascist cause among those already disgruntled with our rule.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME17700;Fascist Trade Unions;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC17700;The fascists in one of our states have organized an anti-socialist trade union, dedicated to promoting what it calls 'the organic relationship between labour and capital', under a more general corporativist umbrella. The union is directly subordinate to the fascist party, and has reportedly already been able to scrounge up quite an impressive membership list. We can attempt to suppress this organization, but that risks driving workers to the socialist trade unions instead.;;;;;;x;

EVTNAME2510;SS $CAPITAL$ Explodes!;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC2510;The SS $CAPITAL$, a small military steamer, mysteriously sank yesterday while on port call in a foreign harbor, following a massive explosion on the starboard midship. Military Intelligence suggests that the explosion may have been caused by an overheated boiler, but the widely circulated scandal press, taking its usual liberties with truth in favor of expediency, has already seized the opportunity and are calling the explosion an act of sabotage and aggression by a foreign power. Our citizens are in ire over the affair, and calls for foreign blood to be spilled can be heard echoing on the streets of $CAPITAL$, the ships' namesake.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC2520;Our ambassador to one of the other great powers has telegraphed home expressing his frustration with the response, or rather, lack of it, that he has received while trying to settle a bilateral extradition treaty with the country in question. Apparently our ambassador has been snubbed repeatedly by this foreign administration, and has been delegated to speaking to civil servants instead of being allowed direct access to the country's decision makers.

EVTDESC2530;A colonial regiment in one of our colonies has had an encounter with a regiment from another colonial power, which had, according to a military report, crossed into our colonial claim on an obscure waterway a fair distance into the colony's hinterland. The report further goes on to state that this foreign regiment was, when encountered by our patrol, in the process of conducting a geological survey of the area, the object of which is as of yet unknown to us. Hawkish members of our war cabinet see this as a direct assault on $COUNTRY$'s territorial integrity, and call for the execution of a plan they have termed, quite simply, 'Operation $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fury'.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC2540;On this subject I would like to bring up the issue of a merchant, operating out of one of my constituencies, who wrote to me last month with a most distressing story of how trade goods of his had been seized by customs officials in a foreign port. Again, I can only reiterate that further tolerance of these abridgments of the unrestricted freedom of international trade will only serve to compound the problem further with every year that passes.'\n\nAn MP known for his ardent support of free trade has held a speech in parliament today, detailing grievances against a foreign power.;;;;;;x;

During the Napoleonic wars, Prussia ceded Neuchâtel after the country's defeat at the hands of Napoleon. After the Napoleonic wars, Neuchâtel was joined with Switzerland as the 21st canton thereof, at the suggestion of Frederick William III of Prussia, while at the same time also remaining a Prussian principality pro forma.

EVTDESC16010;John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul is marching on.'--John Brown's Body, Union Marching song\n\nThe famed hero of the abolitionist movement, the late John Brown, was hanged in Charles Town, Virginia, today after a failed raid on a military armory. Supposedly, Brown had planned to use the arsenal's weapons to arm slaves and incite an open slave rebellion across the entire south. The raid, and John Brown's death, have furthered escalated southern tension over the slavery issue, and in some slave-states there is now even talk of secession from the Union.;;;;;;x;

This morning the congressmen from the Southern states resigned their offices, and the slave states declared secession from the perpetual Union.

The gardens were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and functioned as a place of residence for the Qing Emperors. The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. While the torching was a major blow to Chinese morale, it was also decried by many European intellectuals, Victor Hugo among others, as a criminal act of brutality directed against the Chinese.

clear_out_the_manchu_elite_desc;Since the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese Imperial administration and bureaucracy had been dominated by a powerful Manchu elite, and the Qing emperors had traditionally discriminated heavily against ethnic Han. In the 1860s, Empress Dowager Cixi effectively ended this practice, when she entrusted the country's most powerful military unit to a man of Han background, Zeng Guofan, during the suppression of the Taiping rebellion.

Following the withdrawal of Napoleon's armies from Egypt Muhammad, through a long series of political maneuvering, came to be elected Wali (governor) of Ottoman Egypt, a position he would eventually use to secure Egypt as his own personal domain as Mamluk power waned. During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, european-style, state. Among other things he constructed a shipyard in Alexandria, brought much of Egypt's farmland under direct state control, and sent missions to Europe to collect and bring western knowledge and technology to Egypt. By instituting these reforms, we can take Egypt a small step closer to modernization.;;;;;;x;

enact_radical_reconstruction_desc;Reconstruction is the collective term used to described the policies, laws, decrees, constitutional amendments and presidential orders enacted, after the American Civil War, with the goal of reintegrating the former Confederate states back into the Union. The policies centered chiefly around issues like the ending of 'Slave Power', the suppression of Southern nationalism and revanchism, and the recognition of the 13th amendment by the Southern states. Reconstruction ended with the compromise 1877, when federal troops where finally withdrawn from the South.

A secret vigilante group, known for its iconic symbolism of burning crosses and white hoods and robes, the KKK was formed in opposition to the tenets of Republican Reconstruction, dedicated to preserving white supremacy in the former Confederate states. The Klan shunned few means in accomplishing its goal, and violence directed at southern republicans and blacks was rule rather than exception. The Klan was suppressed by the Federal Government by the passing of the Force Acts of 1871, during the first term of Ulyssess S. Grant. Today we received news that burning crosses have been seen, blazing against the warm, dark night skies of the South.;;;;;;x;

abolish_serfdom_desc;The institution of serfdom -- unfree farm labour tied to the land of a local noble, effectively a form of feudal slavery -- had existed in various forms in Russia since the Kievan Rus of the 11th century. Throughout the ages the institution had undergone several reforms and changes, but the first steps toward a complete abolishment were taken only in the 1810s, when the institution was abolished in the Russian domains of Kurland, Estonia and Livonia. The institution was only abolished in all of Russia with the agrarian reform of 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, who at the time feared that the Russian peasantry might otherwise seek their liberation through outright revolution.;;;;;;x;

tanzimat_reforms_desc;Tanzimat' Turkish for 'reorganization' was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire's vast and varied ethnic minorities. The reforms aimed at integrating the various populations under the common banner of 'Ottomanism', by promoting the Ottoman state as an alternative to the ethnicity based nation states that many of the radicalized minorities within the state were, at the time, seeking to establish, and by granting increased representation and autonomy within the state. While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.;;;;;;x;

While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camarón, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century.

fatherland_volunteers_desc;During The War of The Triple Alliance, when Paraguayan troops invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, Pedro II, the Brazilian Emperor, angered by what he saw as incompetence on part of the Brazilian military, demanded that he himself be allowed to go in person to the front. When both the Cabinet and the National Assembly refused his wish, Pedro threatened to abdicate the imperial throne and join the army as a volunteer, reportedly saying that 'If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer'. Naturally, the Cabinet was left without much choice. Brazilians who later volunteered during the war were called 'Fatherland Volunteers', in memory of Pedro's quote.

By signing the treaty we will lose our claim to Belgium, but our standing in the eyes of the world will improve.;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC16001;The one issue that the Founding Fathers of our great nation were never able to answer conclusively, was the question concerning the status of slavery within the union. This inflamed debate has only gained traction in the years since the revolution, and it is presently the singular most important issue on our country's political agenda. Some radical southerners feel that there is no possible compromise to be found on the issue, and that secession is the only alternative to being dominated into emancipation by the central power in Washington. Should our Senate ever be in a position to force political reform on the South, a 40 percent Liberal Upper House, we can be certain that it will not happen without opposition.;;;;;;x;

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all (French) aggression.

call_geneva_convention_title;The Geneva Convention;;;;;;x;
call_geneva_convention_desc;Having seen the brutality and horror of the aftermath of the battle of Solferino, Jean Henri Dunant, in 1862, published a witness account of the battle called 'Un Souvenir de Solferino' (A Memory of Solferino), printed at his own expense. Drawing on his experiences, Dunant began formulating ideas about setting up an international organization dedicated to the treating of war wounded, and also toured Switzerland extensively to lecture. Against the backdrop of such ideas, the Swiss parliament, in 1864, called an international convention at Geneva to establish international laws for the conduct of war.;;;;;;x;

the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_title;Edgardo Mortara;;;;;;x;
the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_desc;Edgardo Mortara was born to Jewish parents in Bologna in 1851. During a period of illness in 1857, a Catholic servant girl of the Mortara family baptized Edgardo, for fear that he might otherwise, as a non-christian, go to Hell if he died. On the basis of this baptism, the Papal States' police took Edgardo away from his family, and had him raised as a Roman Catholic, as non-christians were, according to Papal States' law, forbidden to raise Christian children, even their own. The case, or kidnapping, caused an international uproar, and was protested by, among others, Napoleon III, Emperor Franz Josef and The London Times. Mortara himself would go on to become a Catholic priest, and resumed contact with his siblings and mother in his later life.;;;;;;x;

The council was convened to address the perceived problems of the modern ideologies of liberalism, rationalism and materialism, as well as to further define Catholic dogma. While the council was cut short by the capture of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, it still left a lasting impression on Catholic theology in the form of the formalized Dogma of Papal Infallibility.;;;;;;x;
