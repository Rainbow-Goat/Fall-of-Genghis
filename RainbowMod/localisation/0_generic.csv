CAMPAIGN_NAME;The Fall of Genghis;x;
CAMPAIGN_DESC;Once upon a time a man named Genghis Khan was about to go west and conquer the world. However, when he reached the Urals he got scared due to a fear of heights, so instead he went south to Indonesia and started a spa resort. This led to the western slavic people being more organized, culminating in the Bohemian coup where the emperor of the HRE was overthrown and a slavic emperor took his place. It has now been 15 years since the Great German revolt was crushed by the emperor, and the armies of Europe are preparing for yet another hugbox gank. Pick your nation, and let your weapons sing lovely melodies.;x;
