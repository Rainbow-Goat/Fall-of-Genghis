peking_convention_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;;;;;;x;;

Arronax maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor Arronax's many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms -- supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel -- will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come.;;;;;;x;;

the_congo_conference_desc;The Congo Conference, also known as the 'Berlin Conference', was an international conference held in 1884 at the initiative of German Chancellor Otto Graf von Bismarck. The immediate consequences of the 'General Act' adopted at the conference was a formalization of the rules of engagement for colonial expansion in Africa, and the confirmation of The Congo Free State as the personal property of King Leopold II of Belgium. What will be the outcome this time around? Host The Congo Conference, and let the dice be cast! We should be ready to send invitations to other countries within a few months of enacting this decision.;;;;;;x;;

The main issue on the table is a definitive settling of The Congo Question. One delegate nation will be given the exclusive right to control and exploit colonial Congo. Secondary Powers, Nations without a colonial empire and Powers already laying claims to areas in the Congo will receive preferential consideration in the negotiations.;;;;;;x;;

The Conference has confirmed, in the 'General Act' released today, that $COUNTRY$ will be accorded the right to rule, exploit and colonize the Congo.

Among the ideas implemented by von Moltke were a department for historical studies, extensive wargaming exercises and a special department dedicated to cataloging and studying the telegraph and railway networks of Prussia, and how they could be used to best effect in the event of war. The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia's General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, it's methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad. Moltke remained Chief of the Prussian Staff for the next 30 years, and is known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of the 19th century.;;;;;;x;;
