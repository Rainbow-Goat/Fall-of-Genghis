the_throne_of_lorraine_desc;Ever since the Burgundian menace defeated us in the 17 years war we have had to endure the humiliation of Lorraine being in a personal union with them. With our unification we are now strong enough to not have to suffer this slight any longer! To war!;x;

occitan_accepted_title;Revoke the Edict of Villers-Cotterêts;x;
occitan_accepted_desc;Strangely enough, all frenchmen are not french. To remedy this we must integrate one of the larger minority groups in the country, the occitan. One of the main gripes Occitanian nationalists hold against us is the edict of Villers-Cotterêts which forces the usage of French in all administrative matters. By revoking this edict the Occitan people may finally give up their foolish dream of a independent Occitania.;x;
norman_accepted_title;The Treaty of Paris;x;
norman_accepted_desc;Now that we directly control the domain of Normandy we need to deal with the normans living there. By signing a treaty protecting their rights and giving them voting rights, we can finally get them to agree to be not just de facto part of France, but de jure aswell.;x;

unite_the_duchies_desc;After the end of the 17 years war and the ensuing liberation war France has been nothing but a lose confederation of highly independent duchies, nowhere near the power of the old Kingdom of France.

With recent political developments however, we might finally be able to unite with the loyal duchies to reclaim the crown of France!;x;

In the cities of Italy there is no man who is not jealous of our marvelous rivers, mountains and coast. France has endured, and we shall endure for another 1000 years! Vive le France!;x;
EVTOPTA100103;Long may She live!;x;
