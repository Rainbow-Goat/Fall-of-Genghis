the_throne_of_lorraine_desc;Ever since the Burgundian menace defeated us in the 17 years war we have had to endure the humiliation of Lorraine being in a personal union with them. With our unification we are now strong enough to not have to suffer this slight any longer! To war!;;x;

occitan_accepted_desc;Strangely enough, all frenchmen are not french. To remedy this we must integrate one of the larger minority groups in the country, the occitan. One of the main gripes Occitanian nationalists hold against us is the edict of Villers-Cotterêts which forces the usage of French in all administrative matters. By revoking this edict the Occitan people may finally give up their foolish dream of a independent Occitania.;;x;
