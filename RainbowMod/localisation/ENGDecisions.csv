accept_norse_desc;Ever since the St Brice's Day massacre the norse people inhabiting our lands have seen us as untrustworthy. While in the past we have not bothered dealing with the problem due to our uninvolvement in most European affairs, recent developments make a stable homefront a neccesity. Regretably nowadays you cannot commit a massacre in Europe without people getting mad, so we must instead finally sign a treaty with the norse people so that they will identify as Englishmen.;;x;

alternative_to_germany_desc;While we could stay here on our island and not care about what goes on in Europe it is simply not possible to do so. The brutal savages in the Holy Slavic Empire are oppressing our German brothers and we cannot turn a blind eye any longer! The German states are too weak to form a independent german nation due to burgundian and bohemian domineering so we must do it for them! Deutschland den Deutschen, ausländer raus!;;x;
